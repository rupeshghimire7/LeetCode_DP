# LeetCode_Solutions
This repository has my solutions to problems of LeetCode in Python3.

Each 
```
.py
```
file has the background, examples and constraints associated with them.
Even though these solutions are not the best in terms of Time and Space Complexities, these are easy to understand and have good enough runtime.
